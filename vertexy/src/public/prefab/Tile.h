	// The symmetry of a square can be presented as:
	//   D4 = < a,b : a^4 = b^2 = e, ab = ba^-1 >
	// in which D4 is the group of symmetries (Dihedral group) of the square, <a> represents a 90
	// degree rotation, <b> represents horizontal reflection and <e> its identity.
	// A square has in total a set of 8 symmetries and can be composed as:
	//   [e, ea, ea^2, ea^3, eb, eba, eba^2, eba^3]
	// We can enumerate them as configuration 0 to 7.
	// When using square tiles, some of those compositions are not symmetric, and we can represent
	// those asymmetries with the characters X, I, /, T, L and F.
	// For example an X is isomorphic for all configurations, and F is anisomorphic for all configurations.
	// The cardinality of a tile represents the the set size for all configurations.
	// So X has a cardinality of 1, since doesn't matter what operations we perform, we get the same tile.
