## Solver Visualizer

* To use the visualizer, double click `index.html`
* You'll be prompted to upload a file, which should be the output of the solver's `write()` function
* Once you do, you'll be met with the icicle visualizer; mouse over the icicles to see information on them
* Uploading a different file will refresh the visualization
